        Investing with Minimal Savings: A Guide for Women
      </h1>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        Many believe that significant capital is required to start investing,
        but this isn’t true. This guide focuses on how women can begin investing
        even with minimal savings. The key is starting early, even with small
        amounts, and focusing on consistency rather than perfection.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-5 mb-3">
        1. Start Small with Low-Cost Investments
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        Low-cost investment options like Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), index
        funds, and mutual funds allow you to get started with minimal savings.
        These options provide broad exposure to the stock market with low fees,
        making them ideal for new investors. You don’t need thousands of dollars
        to start investing — many platforms allow you to invest with as little
        as ₹500 or ₹1000.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-5 mb-3">
        2. Automate Your Investments
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        One of the best ways to build wealth is by automating your investments.
        Set up automatic transfers from your paycheck or bank account into your
        investment account. This "set-it-and-forget-it" method ensures that
        you're consistently investing, even if it's a small amount each month.
        Over time, these small investments can grow significantly through the
        power of compound interest.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-5 mb-3">
        3. Tackle Debt while Investing
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        It’s essential to balance paying off debt with investing. While
        high-interest debt like credit card debt should be paid down first, you
        can still invest while managing your loans. Focus on investing in
        low-risk assets while gradually paying off debt. This way, you're
        building wealth and securing your financial future while becoming
        debt-free.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-5 mb-3">
        4. Financial Independence and Empowerment
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        For women, investing isn't just about wealth; it's about financial
        independence and empowerment. By building a strong investment portfolio,
        women can gain control over their financial future, avoid dependency,
        and plan for long-term goals like buying a home or retirement.
        Prioritizing personal finance and investing is critical for achieving
        these milestones.
